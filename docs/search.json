(Heck even I still have a lot of room to improve in this!)\nThis project was created for my simulations and computation class and looked at violating the assumptions of equal variance and normality of t-tests and ANOVA."

    "text": "Having the opportunity to be a teaching assistant has been one of the highlights of my time at OSU. Throughout my experience I’ve found immense fulfillment in being able to be involved with so many remarkable students. The diverse background of students has highlighted one of my favorite aspects of statistics which is being able to be involved in so many different fields. It has afforded me the opportunity to learn about so many topics and hear perspectives I never would have been exposed to otherwise. Additionally it has also allowed me to become a better communicator and presenter.\nThe responsibilities of a teaching assistant are fairly standard across all classes that I have been involved with. All of them have involved some form of teaching (either in programming labs or recitations), grading, and holding office hours.\n\n\n\nST 351 (4x) & ST 352 (course size ~200, lab sizes ~30)\n\nST 351 and 352 are introductory statistics courses aimed at undergraduate students with little to no statistics experience. These courses teach students common statistical methods like t-tests, anova, slr, mlr, and \\(\\chi^2\\) tests. In addition to teaching these methods these courses teach students how to use R in order to perform these methods in practice.\n\nST 421/521 & 422/522 (Course size ~40 & ~15, recitation size ~40 & ~15)\n\nThese are two introductory courses in mathematical statistics, they serve to introduce students to core concepts in theoretical statistics like probability distributions, expectations, the central limit theorem, properties of estimators, and hypothesis testing all through a slightly more rigorous framework than students have seen before.\n\nST 411/511 (Course size ~200, lab section sizes ~30)\n\nThis class is aimed largely at graduate students to provide them with some of the statistical methods commonly seen in research."
