I have found that students don’t really have any concept of what it looks like when assumptions are reasonably met and how far we can stretch assumptions while still getting useful results. (Heck even I still have a lot of room to improve in this!)\nThis project was created for my simulations and computation class and looked at violating the assumptions of equal variance and normality of t-tests and ANOVA."
